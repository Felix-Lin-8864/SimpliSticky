## The Project

### Aim
Primary Aim: To develop a practical chrome extension, and learn basic frontend programming in doing so.

Secondary Aim: To have a way to take quick persistant notes at work.

### Composition
![JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=black) ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?logo=css3&logoColor=white)

Basic note taking application utilising JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Chrome API used for storage specifically for its syncing abilities.

### Deployments
Deployed publicly as a chrome extension. This endpoint was chosen as it met my concept's requirements: an avenue for an unintrusive note taking application/tool, easily accessible, cheap (Chrome Developer account incurs a one-time $5 fee and allows 20 extensions to be published).
